- Brute-force algorithm with only compiler optimizations is 
  17x slower the scikit-learn KNN with brute-force algorithm 

- Optimizations:
    - use openBLAS/Eigen libraries for euclidean distance

- Reduced function calls in the prediction function with 
  STL functions and nested loops

- Brought slowness down to only ~6.1%
