Train:
    - Iterate through samples
    - Calculate distance from origin
        - no need to calculate root
    - Populate Hash map
        - Key: vector
            - use murmur hash
        - Value: tuple (distance, class)

Inference:
    - Find distance of current point from rest
    - Sort vector
    - Find most appearing class from top K indices
